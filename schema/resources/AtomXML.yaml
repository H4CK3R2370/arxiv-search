            A unique id for this query, and is useful if you are writing a 
            program such as a feed reader that wants to keep track of all the
            feeds requested in the past. This id can then be used as a key in
            a database. The id is guaranteed to be unique for each query.

            The last time the contents of the feed were last updated. Because
            the arXiv submission process works on a 24 hour submission cycle, 
            new articles are only available to the API on the midnight after 
            the articles were processed. The updated property thus reflects
            the midnight of the day that you are calling the API. This is very
            important - search results do not change until new articles are 
            added. Therefore there is no need to call the API more than once
            in a day for the same query. Please cache your results. This
            primarily applies to production systems, and of course you are
            free to play around with the API while you are developing your
            program!

            the article retrieved was version 2, so <updated> and <published>

            The abstract for the article.
          type: string
          example: |
            Multi-electron production is studied at high electron transverse momentum
            in positron- and electron-proton collisions using the H1 detector at HERA.
            The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 115 pb-1. Di-electron
            and tri-electron event yields are measured. Cross sections are derived in
            a restricted phase space region dominated by photon-photon collisions. In
            general good agreement is found with the Standard Model predictions.
            However, for electron pair invariant masses above 100 GeV, three
            di-electron events and three tri-electron events are observed, compared to
            Standard Model expectations of 0.30 \pm 0.04 and 0.23 \pm 0.04,
            respectively.
